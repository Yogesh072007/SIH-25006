## Problem Title
SIH 25006: Development of a Digital Farm Management Portal for implementing Biosecurity measures in Pig and Poultry Farms
## Problem Description
### Background

Biosecurity is a cornerstone of animal health management, particularly in the pig and poultry sectors, where disease outbreaks such as Avian Influenza and African Swine Fever can cause significant economic losses, threaten food security, and disrupt rural livelihoods. Despite its importance, many farmers—especially smallholders in resource-limited areas—struggle to access practical, actionable information on biosecurity protocols, risk assessment tools, and regulatory compliance requirements.

### Problem Description

There is an urgent need for a user-friendly, digital platform that empowers farmers to implement, monitor, and sustain robust biosecurity practices on their farms. This portal should offer end-to-end solutions for farm-level biosecurity management by integrating:

• Customizable risk assessment tools based on local epidemiological conditions.
• Interactive training modules and best practice guidelines tailored for pig and poultry production systems.
• Compliance tracking features aligned with regulatory frameworks to help farmers work toward disease-free compartment recognition.
• Real-time alerts and monitoring dashboards for disease outbreaks and biosecurity breaches.
• Multilingual and mobile-first design to ensure accessibility in remote and rural areas.

The platform should also enable data collection and analysis for policy support, foster collaborative networking among stakeholders (farmers, veterinarians, extension workers, etc.), and promote long-term resilience and sustainability in the livestock sector.

### Expected Outcomes

• Enhanced farmer awareness and education on biosecurity.
• Improved risk management at the farm level as well as self-assessment.
• Easy access to customized biosecurity protocols and guidelines.
• Digital record-keeping and compliance tracking.
• Timely alerts and disease notifications to farmers.
• Healthier livestock and increased farm productivity.
• Empowerment of small and marginal farmers with limited resources.
• Support to authorities in data-driven surveillance and policy making.
• Stronger collaboration across the livestock ecosystem.
• Improved national preparedness for zoonotic and transboundary diseases.

## Proposed Solution
The proposed solution is to develop a Digital Farm Biosecurity Management Portal designed specifically for pig and poultry farms. This platform will simplify biosecurity implementation by providing digital tools, real-time guidance, training, and automated monitoring. The system will support farmers in improving biosecurity practices through intuitive workflows, alerts, and compliance tracking.

The key components of the solution are:

1.Risk Assessment Engine: Automatically evaluates farm-level risks using factors such as livestock density, disease history, hygiene practices, and movement tracking.

2.Interactive Learning System: Provides multilingual training modules, certification tests, and step-by-step guidelines for preventive measures.

3.Compliance & Record Management: Tracks vaccination, disease reporting, visitor logs, feed hygiene, and sanitation practices with automated reminders.

4.Real-Time Alert System: Sends early warnings during outbreaks, suspicious activities, farm entry logs, or deviation from compliance indicators.

5.Data Analytics & Reporting: Helps farmers and authorities analyze trends, take preventive actions, and support policy-making.

6.Mobile-First Interface: Ensures accessibility in rural regions with offline functionality for low network areas.

## How It Addresses the Problem

✔ Provides farmers with accessible and practical digital biosecurity guidance
✔ Tracks and monitors hygiene compliance with automated workflows
✔ Reduces outbreak risk through real-time alerts and early detection
✔ Supports authorities with disease surveillance and traceability
✔ Enables knowledge transfer through trained digital modules

## Innovation and Uniqueness

1.First platform combining biosecurity compliance, disease surveillance, training, and farm management in one application.

2.Uses AI-based risk scoring and behavior-based alerts.

3.Incorporates offline mode and vernacular support to maximize rural accessibility.

4.Allows integration with IoT devices (RFID tags, smart cameras, temperature sensors) for automation.
